<h2 id="command-line-cms">Command Line CMS</h2>
<p>3 May 2014  </p>
<p>In my previous post I talked about setting up this site. This post looks at how I&#39;ve extended it 
since then, namely improvements to managing the content. The brief specification I wrote looked 
like this:  </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Individual post pages</li>
<li>Disqus commenting</li>
<li>Post summaries on the index page</li>
<li>Writing posts in Markdown</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The functionality I&#39;ve added addresses point 4 and puts the site in a good position to implement 
points 1 and 3. There are a few constraints I am working with, I&#39;ll mention them here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I host this site for free with <a href="http://000webhost.com">000webhost.com</a>. The resources 
however are largely enough for my needs.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t have access to the command line on the server.</li>
<li>I work on this site in my spare time between revising for 3rd year degree exams and being a husband and a wife. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assessing-the-situation">Assessing the situation</h3>
<p>Obviously Wordpress jumps to mind. It&#39;s free, has a great number of plugins, has a good community 
supporting it and regularly contributing, etc. However I didn&#39;t want to go back to theming again, 
I just sorted that out. I didn&#39;t want to mess with syntax highlighting again or their 
documentation for how to output a blog title or some other suck niggly problem. So a one of the 
nice big blog softwares was probably out of the question. I wanted a simple, drop in package that 
gave me the functionality I needed, or could be easily extended, without me having to learn their 
API and go back trawling through the markup and CSS.</p>
<p>After a bit of internal deliberation, I decided to put something together myself. Not trying to 
reinvent the wheel but also not getting stuck with a blog software that was overpowered for my 
needs and would cause more hassle in the long run if I wanted to extended it in the future.</p>
<p>I was starting to get an idea of what I wanted or rather what I wanted to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&#39;t want to have to worry about security, users, logins etc. These would detract my attention from writing actual blog functionality and would slow the whole process up.</li>
<li>I didn&#39;t want to put a huge amount of effort into the writing interface. I already had a nice work flow, writing in vim with access to the command line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-decision">The Decision</h3>
<p>Therfore I decided to write a command line CMS. I could write the blog posts in one directory, the CMS could process these and output them to the <code>www/</code> dir. The system could operate on my local machine and then to publish the new posts I could simply FTP transfer the whole <code>www/</code> dir to the server.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>My final directory structure looks like this, printed using <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?tree"><code>tree</code></a>:
