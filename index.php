			<h1>Hello there</h1>
			<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio. This is my space to display my work, 
			write some thoughts down and generally try to keep up with what's going on. 
			I hope to keep the site updated as best I can, 
			please shoot me an email if you discover a problem.</p>
			<p>Thanks - David</p>

			<h2>The who and what</h2>
			<p>I am David Normington, currently studying Computer Science at the University of Kent, UK.
			I'm a web developer, I mostly work on server side projects but started out learning 
			front end languages.</p>
			<p>This is my portfolio and space to publish my work and keep things organised. 
			My blog also lives here which I use to annotate some of my work but it's a lonely old thing,
			without a lot of life but useful to me to jot down the odd thought or experiment.</p>
